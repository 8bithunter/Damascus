# Features
- All functions are supported! Use premade functions in "System.Numerics.Complex", or write your own!
- Easily input any desired value, and receive the output, derivative, and integral (from the starting value) at that point.
- Along with direct inputs, Damascus allows you to generate maps of your chosen function, enabling you to visualize the shape of functions and identify zeroes.
- Two by two matrices are now supporting, letting you see the effect of transformations on any vector.
